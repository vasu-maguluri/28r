  <h1> HTML Concepts Introduction</h1>
  <p>
    <b>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</b> is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For
    example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data
    tables.
    Like any language, HTML has syntax. This means that, in order for your code to be considered “well formed” (the HTML
    equivalent of grammatically correct), you must follow certain foundational rules. Failing to follow these rules
    means that a computer will not understand your HTML code.
